# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue
or Discord before making a change. 

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.


## Pull Request Process

1. Pull requests should be made against the `dev` branch.
2. Ensure that the changed library can be built on your target system. Do not introduce any platform-
   specific code.
3. Ensure that all methods and functions you add are **fully documented** using doxygen style comments.
4. Test your commit! Make a simple single-file test bot to demonstrate the change, include this with the PR 
   as an attached file on a comment, so we can test and see how it works.
5. Ensure that you do not break any existing API calls without discussing on Discord first!
6. Be sure to follow the coding style guide (if you are not sure, match the code style of existing files
   including indent style etc).
